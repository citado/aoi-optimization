# AoI Optimization in LoRaWAN

## Introduction

Here I am going to describe and tying to solve an optimization problem
around age of information in LoRaWAN.
Basis of the problem is about to predict resource allocation
in LoRaWAN networks to minimize (average/peak) of age of information.

## How to Run

Gurobi suite is really awesome, it has many open-source and free to use licenses:

```sh
poetry install
poetry shell
```
